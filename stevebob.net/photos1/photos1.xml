So I know that this is **well** overdue, but here are some photos I have taken around Toronto. The camera I'm using is the one on my phone, so the quality is not great (though I was impressed with its ability to take night photos, since it's a phone and all).
<h2>U of T</h2>

Photos from both the downtown and Scarborough campuses of U of T.

These are some trees at the Scarborough campus of U of T. I remember thinking "hey the trees look kinda neat with snow on them..." while onlookers were all like "why is that guy taking photos of the trees?".

<h2>Royal Ontario Museam and Downtown Toronto</h2>
I decided to go to the ROM, and figured it would be a good time to do some exploring.

<img src="8-7.jpg" 
      alt="This is a corkscrew-shaped tunnel made by an ancient beaver. It's a clever way to dig; you can easily climb out, and won't fall into lava if the block below you has lava under it."

<h2>Skiing</h2>
These photos were taken at the Dagmar Ski Resort.

<h2>...and that's all for now</h2>
This is the busy part of semester, so photos will be less frequent for the next few weeks. After that, I'll be becoming a full blown tourist and travelling around Canada and probably the USA, so there will be lots of photos.
