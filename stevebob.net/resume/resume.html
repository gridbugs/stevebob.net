<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>I'm a fifth year Computer Science student at the University of New South Wales.
I'm currently completing my honours thesis at NICTA, where I'm learning
about operating systems, virtualization, and writing low-level systems code.
My major hobby is programming; I spend lots of my spare time writing programs or
learning new techniques.</p>

<p>I will finish my undergraduate degree and be ready to start full time work in July 2014.</p>
