## Amsterdam
Today was my last day in Amsterdam (for now at least). It was the first time since
arriving in The Netherlands that I've behaved, quite unabashedly, like a tourist.
My day included exploring the botanical gardens, buying a watch at a street market, making friends with some strangers
at a cafe, taking photos of canals, watching a soccer match played by *real people*, and getting
a haircut and a cup of coffee...*at the same time*.
