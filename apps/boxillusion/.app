An illusion of solid faces.

LongDescription:
<
I wrote this while waiting for a plane in Sydney Airport.
It uses semi-transparent faces drawn in an arbitrary order to give the illusion of solid faces.
All external surfaces are white because there are always 2 layers of surfaces drawn overlapping.
Interior surfaces only have 1 layer, making them appear grey over the black background.
