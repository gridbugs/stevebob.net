LongDescription:
<
This is a 3D version of {hero, link: hero}. It uses
the same rules for movement, but applied in three
dimensions. It uses the 3D engine from {three, link: three}.

The movement rules are  based on a social game.
It is played by a room full of people.
Each person chooses someone to be their hero
and someone to be their villain (but don't tell them).
Then, each person tries to position themselves in
the room such that their hero is between them
and their villain.
