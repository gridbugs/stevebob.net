<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
A fractal is a shape which can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced size copy of the whole.
In this app, a fractal is modelled as a base shape and a set of repetitions.
<br />
Here is some terminology used in this app:
<table border=1>
<tr><td><strong>base shape</strong></td>
    <td>The shape that is to be repeated. This shape will be redrawn for each
    repetition.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>repetition</strong></td>
    <td>A list of information describing how the base shape will change each
    time it is redrawn. Information includes: scale factor, rotation factor,
    offset distance, offset angle.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>scale factor</strong></td>
    <td>Change in size. The unit of the new shape will be
    the current shape's unit multiplied by the scale factor.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>rotation factor</strong></td>
    <td>The rotation of the new shape. It is added onto the the zero angle of
    the current shape to get the zero angle of the new shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>distance offset</strong></td>
    <td>The number of units the new shape is from the old shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>angle offset</strong></td>
    <td>The angle between a line from the new shape's centre to the current
    shape's centre and the current shape's zero angle.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>depth</strong></td>
    <td>The number of times the repetitions will be applied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>to <strong>apply</strong> a <strong>repetition</strong></td>
    <td>For each instance of the shape, for each repetition, a new shape is
    created using the information in the repetition to modify the instance of
    the shape. As these new shapes are shapes, the next repetition will also be
    applied to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>unit</strong></td>
    <td>The global distance of a local '1'. It can be used to resize the entire
    fractal.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>view window</strong></td>
    <td>The xMin, xMax, yMin and yMax coordinates that are visible on the
    srceen.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>initial centre</strong></td>
    <td>The Cartesian coordinates of the (0, 0) of the base shape. It can be
    used to move the entire fractal.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>initial zero angle</strong></td>
    <td>The global angle that the base shape uses for its local zero angle. It
    can be used to rotate the entire fractal.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Commands</h2>

At the moment the app can only be controlled from the command line at the bottom of the screen.
Enter commands and press enter to have them evaluated.
Use the up/down arrow keys to navigate command history.
The output from the most recent command is displayed just above the command line.
The list of commands can be separated into two groups: <strong>expressive</strong> and <strong>non-expressive</strong>.<br />
Expressive commands are expressions; they return something, and can be nested and used with other commands to compute values.<br />
Non-expressive commands do something in the program (like draw a line). They don't return anything (so are not expressions). 
Expressive commands can be used in arguments for non-expressive commands, but not vice versa. Only one non-expressive command
may be used at a time.<br />
<br /><br />
Expressive Commands:
<table border=1>
<tr><td><strong>add(a, b)</strong></td>
    <td>returns a + b</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>minus(a, b)</strong></td>
    <td>returns a - b</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>multiply(a, b)</strong></td>
    <td>returns a * b</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>divide(a, b)</strong></td>
    <td>returns a / b</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>power(a, b)</strong></td>
    <td>returns a<sup>b</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>factorial(a)</strong></td>
    <td>returns a!</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>pi()</strong></td>
    <td>returns pi</td></tr>
</table>

<br />
Non-Expressive Commands:
<table border=1>
<tr><td><strong>line(x1, y1, x2, y2)</strong></td>
    <td>creates a new line in the base shape (and all repetitions) from (x1, y1)
    to (x2, y2)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>repeat(s, r, d, a)</strong></td>
    <td>creates a new repetition with a scale factor of -, a rotation factor of
    r, a distance offset of d and an angle offset of a.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>rmline(n)</strong></td>
    <td>removes line with index n from the base shape</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>rmrepeat(n)</strong></td>
    <td>removes repetition with index n</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>clearall()</strong></td>
    <td>removes all lines and repetitions</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>export()</strong></td>
    <td>This opens a text field which contains a textual representation of your current
    metashape session. You can copy the text to a text file and use the 
    <strong>import()</strong> command to load your session on a different
    computer or save a session for future reference. The app constantly updates
    its cookie with your current session, so you can close and open the page
    without losing your work.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>import()</strong></td>
    <td>This opens a text field into which you can paste a textual representation of
    a metashape session obtained from running the <strong>export()</strong>
    command and press the 'Import' button. Note that this will replace your
    current session so export it first if you want to keep it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>setdepth(n)</strong></td>
    <td>sets the depth of the current fractal to n</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>setunitsize(n)</strong></td>
    <td>changes the unit size of the base shape to n</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>setzeroangle(n)</strong></td>
    <td>changes the zero angle of the base shape to n</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>setcentre(x, y)</strong></td>
    <td>changes the local (0, 0) of the base shape to global (x, y)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>screen(xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax)</strong></td>
    <td>sets the view window's maximum and minimum coordinates</td></tr>

<h2>Formal Language Structure</h2>
action -&gt; [any non-expressive command](expression,...)
<br />
expression -&gt; number | variable | operator(expression,...)

<br />
variable -&gt; [any variable name that has been assigned a value]

<h2>Usage Example</h2>

Enter the following commands on the command line:

<pre>
clearall()                              #clear the display
screen(-15, 15, -10, 10)                #set a nice view window
setcentre(0, 0)                         #centre the shape at the centre of the screen
setunitsize(1)                          #set the unit size to 1
setdepth(5)                             #set a highish depth
line(-2, -2, 2, -2)
line(-2, -2, -2, 2)
line(-2, 2, 2, 2)
line(2, -2, 2, 2)                       #draw a square
repeat(0.5, 0, 4, 0)
repeat(0.5, 0, 4, pi())
repeat(0.5, 0, 4, divide(pi(), 2))
repeat(0.5, 0, 4, divide(pi(), -2))     #define some repetitions
</pre>
<br />
That should draw a diamond-shaped fractal.<br />
Here is the importable code for the fractal:
