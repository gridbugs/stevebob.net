LongDescription:
<
This models a dynamic system, where each dot is
randomly assigned a hero dot and villain dot, then
moves to position itself such that its hero is between
itself and its villain.

The movement rules are  based on a social game.
It is played by a room full of people.
Each person chooses someone to be their hero
and someone to be their villain (but don't tell them).
Then, each person tries to position themselves in
the room such that their hero is between them
and their villain.
