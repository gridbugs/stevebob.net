Demo of a wireframe 3D engine

LongDescription:
<
This was the first 3D app I wrote for HTML canvas.
The technique used to calculate 2D positions of 3D points is the same as that which would
be used when drawing by hand in perspective.
I wrote a similar program to this a while ago in QBasic and then again in C.
