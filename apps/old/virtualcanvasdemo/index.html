<h1>Virtual HTML Canvas</h1>
<h2>What exactly is going on here?</h2>
<p>
This page contains a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">HTML5 Canvas Element</a>.
For those new to this technology, a canvas element is a rectangle of pixels upon which can be drawn
various lines, shapes and images using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">javascript</a>.
Most of the demos on <a href="http://stevebob.net">stevebob.net</a> such as <a href="http://stevebob.net/apps/3dtesla">3dtesla</a>
and <a href="http://stevebob.net/apps/fractbox">fractbox</a> use canvas elements to display graphics.
On the left of the page are two apps which have been ported from canvas to virtual canvas.
This allows the two apps to be displayed on the same canvas element.
</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
The images on a regular canvas element are manipulated using javascript methods, called on an object associated with the element.
A virtual canvas is a wrapper for a canvas element. Currently, only a small subset of canvas methods are implemented for
virtual canvas. Only lines and rectangles can be drawn. Each virtual canvas has a location, size and rotation. The virtual canvas
object can be treated as a regular canvas object. Note that there are still some problems to work out, such as the graphics overflowing the
bounds of their allocated space (notice how the lighting doesn't stay in its rectangle).
</p>

<h2>...and this is useful because...</h2>
<p>
In order for a canvas app to have some purpose and not be just a demo or display area for a larger, non-canvas app, the user interface
needs to be separated into multiple parts. For instance, there might be some buttons or other controls or maybe an area for text or graphics.
These are logically separate components of the visual aspect of a web application, and as such should be separated by some mechanism.
One such mechanism is using multiple canvas elements, positioned using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>.
Virtual Canvas objects provide another such mechanism.
</p>

<h2>Porting Demos</h2>
<p>
The first section mentions porting demos from canvas to virtual canvas. Only a small amount of code needed to be changed to make these
demos work side by side in virtual canvas. Namely, conflicting variable and function names had to be changed (since when these demos were
written they were not intended to be run simultaneously), and the assignment statement
for the canvas object was replaced with an assignment statement for a virtual canvas object.
Because these demos only draw lines and rectangles, the methods that were being called on a canvas object are now being called on a virtual
canvas object and it is taking care of translation, rotation and scaling.
