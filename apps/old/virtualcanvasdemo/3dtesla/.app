LongDescription:
<
This is a 3D lightning demo.
It uses a similar method for drawing lightning as
{tesla, link: tesla}.
Lightning starts around the outside of a sphere and works its way to
the centre by sampling a collection of random points around the current
point and choosing the one that gets it closest.
The position of 3D points on the screen are calculated by the same
system used in {three, link: three}.
