GIT Readme:

How to use:
If you've committed a bunch of stuff and want to push, do the following:

git pull

OR

git fetch
git rebase origin/master

The first option is easier, but the second option gives a cleaner history.

If anything goes wrong during an automatic merge, just run
git mergetool
(or git merge-tool? I don't remember)
