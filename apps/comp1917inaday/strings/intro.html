<h1>Strings</h1>

A string is an array of characters. They can be treated exactly like arrays. Additionally, there are a number of functions at your desposal that can do certain operations on strings. You can use printf to print a string. The placeholder is %s. In order to use a string with printf or string functions, all strings must be terminated with a '\0'. '\0' is a special character (like '\n'). It's ascii value is 0. It won't be printed by prinf, and will be treated by all predefined string functions as the end of the string. Note that this is only a convention, but it must allways be adhered to or you will have a lot of trouble using your strings. If you don't terminate your strings, functions will keep going into memory after the end of the array until they see a 0 (which are quite common in memory anyway). If you see random characters after your string, it is probably improperly terminated.

Don't confuse the string terminator with the end of the array. If you have a char array of 20 elements, it can store a string with a maximum length of 19 (as the terminator must also be stored). However the terminator can be anywhere in the array. If you only want your string to be 5 characters long, the sixth element will be the terminator. Information about the length of the array or string is not stored.

Here is an example:

codefile: hellostring.c handle: hellostring code: 1

output:

codefile: stringout handle: stringout code: 0

Firstly, notice that there is another file included: string.h. This contains definitions of string functions like strlen, strcpy and strcat. These are the main generic string functions that you will use. However, you can your own string functions to do just about anything. You will also probably end up writing your own versions of generic string furctions. In fact, lets make one now.

codefile: mystring.c handle: mystring code: 1

This does exactly what the first program does, except now it uses no functions from string.h. While in assignments you will probably be using the functions in string.h, it is good to know how they work so you can make any function you need.
