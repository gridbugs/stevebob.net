<h1>A Note on Style</h1>
CSE has a style guide, and it is worth noting a few aspects of it now:
You lines of code should not be any longer than 70 characters. This includes comments. gedit has the current column in the status bar on the bottom right corner.
Always indent your code when entering a new structure. A rule of thumb is, add an indent the line after a line ending with a "{", and remove an indent on a line with "}".
