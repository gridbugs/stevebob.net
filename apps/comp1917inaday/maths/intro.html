<strong>unsigned</strong> and <strong>long</strong> are keywords that can be used to prepend certain types of variable as they are declaired to give them certain properties. Some examples of this can be found later.

It is important to understand how each type of variable stores data in memory.

<strong>char</strong>
<br />
This is just a single byte unsigned integer. That is, it is always positive and stores an integer between 0 and 255.
They can be interpreted as a character when it matters (ie when dealing with standard input and output) but can also be treated as an integer. The character that a char variable is interpreted as is the ascii character corresponding to the integer value stored.

<strong>int</strong>
<br />
The first bit of an integer represents its sign. A 1 represents a negative number and a 0, a positive number. In order to do mathematical operations on negative binary numbers, a method called 2's compliment is used. Negative numbers are stored in 2's compliment, and can then be added to positive numbers. To subtract two positive binary numbers, one is converted to a negative number and then they are added. To convert a binary number into 2's compliment,
