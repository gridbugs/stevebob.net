<h1>Style with variables</h1>
Always use meaningful names for your variables. Also, CSE's style guide requires that you name your variables with "camel case". The first word of a camel case name begins with a lower case character, and an upper case character is used for the first letter of all other words. (eg. inputNumber) For single world names, the entire name is in lower case.
