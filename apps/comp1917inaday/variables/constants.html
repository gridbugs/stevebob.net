<h1>Symbolic Constants</h1>
Avoid using "magic" numbers. In the examples so far, the code has contained static numbers. For example, on line 4 in the example at the top of the page: "int number = 4;", it is unclear why the number 4 is used. When making a program use constants rather than placing numbers in the code. This will make code easier to read. People reading your code will know what the numbers mean. Also, if the number needs to be changed, you need only change the definition of the constant once, rather than every instance of the number throughout your code.

To define a constant, place the line "#define NAME value" at the top of the file, just below the #include lines. Constant names must be in all upper case. Here is an example of a program with constants. %f is the placeholder for floating points.

codefile: area.c handle: area code: 1
</br>
Output:
codefile: areaout handle: areaout code: 0
When the code is compiled, the references to symbolic constants are exactly replaced with their value. Constants are purely for readibility, but they are still important.
