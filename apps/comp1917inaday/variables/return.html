<h1>Return Values</h1>
Firstly, let's loosely define "expression" as something which can be evaluated with a value.
When a function is said to <strong>return</strong> a value, the evaluation of the function will result in this value. 
The expression "4+4" evaluates to 8, so the code:
<pre class="code">
int n;
n = 4+4;
</pre>
will result with n taking the value 8.
Similarly, a function call is an expression, as long as it has a return value (as some function do not), it can be treated as any other expression. If there was a function "halve()" which returns half of it's argument, the following code:
<pre class="code">
int n;
n = halve(8);
</pre>
would result in n taking the value 4. The same operators can be used on functions as on any other number or variable. In order of operations, functions are evaluated before operators. In the case of nested functions:
<pre class="code">
int n;
n = halve(halve(8)); //this will put the value 2 in n
</pre>
the inner-most function is evaluated first.
