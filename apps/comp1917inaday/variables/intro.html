<h1>Variables in c</h1>
Often it is useful to be able to store data for use in your program. Data can be stored in variables. There are several different types of variable, which can each be used to store different types of data.
These are the main types of variable.<br/>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>C Syntax</th><th>Full Name</th><th>Size (bytes)</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>integer</td><td>4</td><td>Holds an integer value</td></tr>
<tr><td>char</td><td>character</td><td>1</td><td>Holds a chracter</td></tr>
<tr><td>float</td><td>floating point</td><td>4</td><td>Holds a floating point number (number with decimals)</td></tr>
<tr><td>double</td><td>double precision floating point</td><td>8</td><td>Can have more after the decimal place than a floating point</td></tr>
</table>

The sizes of each variable are machine dependent (ie different computers may use different amounts of memory). To find the size of a particular variable, use the sizeof function (see below). These sizes are important as they define size limits on values stored in variables, but more on this later.

Lets use some variables:
</br>
codefile: variables.c handle: variables code: 1
</br>
The output from that is:
</br>
codefile: output handle: varoutput
</br>
On lines 4 and 5 we <strong>declare</strong> the variables. The syntax for declaring a variable is "type name;". Optionally, the variable can be assigned a value at this point by using "type name = value;". After a variable is declared, it can be assigned a value "name = value;". The new value replaces its old value.

In all the printf lines, you will notice %d and %c. These are called "placeholders". printf can do far more than just print static text to standard output. It can be used to print static values, variable values, or return values of functions. Each type of variable has its own placeholder. The first argument to printf must be a string. This string can contain placeholders. The following arguments correspond, in order, to the the placeholders in the string. There can be as many placeholders in the string, as long as exactly the same number of values are specified as the following arguments. %d is a placeholder for integers. %c is for characters. On lines 29 and 30, you can see how using a different placeholder can print a different value for the same variable.
