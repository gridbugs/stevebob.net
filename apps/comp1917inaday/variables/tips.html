<h1>Some Tips</h1>
The convention for file extensions of c source files is .c (hence helloworld.c). For c header files (which you will make later) is .h (hence stdio.h).
When compiling code, take special care not to do this:
<pre class="code">gcc -Wall -Werror -O -o helloworld.c helloworld.c</pre>
Since the output file was named helloworld.c (as opposed to just: helloworld), the binary file would replace the source file. It is impossible to convert a binary file back into a source file.
