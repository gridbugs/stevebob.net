<h1>The sizeof function</h1>
The sizeof function can be used to calculate the number of bytes used to store a particular variable. This function take a variable of any type as an argument, and returns an unsigned long int (this will be explained later). The placeholder for an unsigned long int is %lu.

codefile: size.c handle: size code: 1

The output

codefile: sizeout handle: sizeout code: 0

In that code you can see how the return value functions can be passed as arguments to othur functions. Also, it shows how you can use white space to spread you code out and make it more readable.
