<strong>Integers</strong>
An integer is stored in 4 bytes. This is 32 bits. 32 bits can be arranged in 2^32 different ways. Therefore there are 2^32 different values that can be stored in an integer variable. As an integer is signed, these values range from -2^16 to 2^16-1.

<strong>Characters</strong>
Characters are stored as their ASCII value in a single byte. ASCII values are numeric values, each associated with a particular character. It is important to understand that the actual value that is stored in a character variable is an integer, and can be treated as such when doing maths.

<strong>Floating Points</strong>
