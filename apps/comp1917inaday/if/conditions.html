<h1>Conditions</h1>
A condition is either true or false (but never both). In c, the integer 0 is evaluated as false, and all other values are evaluated as true. For example in the code:
<pre class="code">
if (0) {
    do something;
}
</pre>
the something will not be done, as 0 is false. If the 0 was replaced with any other value, the something would be done. It is common to #define TRUE 1 and #define FALSE 0 to avoid confusion.

More complicated cases involve operators. There are several operators used for comparrison. They are:
== equals
&gt; greater than
&lt; less than
&gt;= greater than or equal to
&lt;= less than or equal to
!= not equal to

Placing a '!' before any condition (like !TRUE or !(a==b)) inverts its logical evaluation (ie false is true and true is false).

It is important to understand thet although these operators are used for comparrison, their syntax and usage is identical to that of regular mathematic operators. They are of the form: operand operator operand, and are evaluated to a number. For example, 5==5 will evaluate to 1, while 5==4 will evaluate to 0.

<h2>And and Or</h2>
The syntax for logical AND is &amp;&amp;
The syntax for logical OR is ||

Use brackets to express complicated logical expressions with more than two conditions. Remember that the entire condition for the if statement must be placed in a set of brackets, in addition to any other sets of brackets that you introduce.

<h2>Lazy Evaluation</h2>
C uses laze evaluation from left to right. If there is a logical expression "a &amp;&amp; b", and "a" is found to be false, then there is no way the expression can be true, so "b" won't be evaluated. Similarly, with "a || b" and "a" is found to be true, the expression is automatillay true and "b" won't be evaluated.
