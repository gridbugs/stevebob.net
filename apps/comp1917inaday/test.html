<h1>Intro to unix command line</h1>
</br><h2>To open a terminal in Mac OS X:</h2>
</br>CMD+SPACE to open spotlight.
</br>Type &quot;terminal&quot; into the search field.
</br>Click on Terminal (the black box icon).
</br>
</br>You will be using this A LOT!
</br>
</br>The prompt refers to the text that appears on the command line before a command is entered.
</br>e.g. <pre>steve$ </pre>
Arguments in the context of the command line refer to text entered after the name of a command/script/binary.
</br>
</br>The unix command line and the C programming language are all CASE SENSITIVE so A and a are considered to be completely different.
</br>
</br>To run a command, type it at the prompt and press ENTER/RETURN.
</br>To run a script/binary, type ./FILENAME at the prompt and press ENTER or PATHTOFILE/FILENAME and press ENTER.
</br>
</br>After running a command, press the up arrow key to have the text for that command copied to the current prompt. You can use this key to view and run previously used commands.
</br>
</br>The &quot;~&quot; character is an alias for your home directory.
</br>e.g.
</br>~/Documents refers to your Documents directory.
</br>Similarly, the &quot;.&quot; character refers to the current or &quot;working&quot; directory and &quot;..&quot; refers to the parent directory (the directory that which contains the working directory).
</br>
</br>Here are some useful commands:
</br>pwd &#45; print working directory. Displays the full path to the current directory.
</br>ls &#45; list all files and directories in current directory
</br>cd DIRECTORY &#45; changes the working directory to DIRECTORY. With no arguments, you are taken to you home directory
</br>mkdir NAME &#45; creates a new directory of name NAME in the working directory
</br>
</br>An example command line:
</br><pre>steve$ pwd
/home/steve                   current directory
steve$ ls
Desktop                       contents of directry
Documents
Music
Videos
steve$ cd Documents           change to ~/Documents directory
steve$ pwd
/home/steve/Documents
steve$ mkdir programs         make a directory named programs
steve$ cd programs
steve$ ls
steve$ cd ..                  go back to ~/Documents
steve$ ls
helloworld.c                  there is now a programs directory
programs
test.c
test
steve$ ls *.c                 * can be used as a wild card
helloworld.c
test.c</pre>

</br>Don't worry, it comes with practice.
</br>If you need help or want more info on a command, type &quot;man COMMAND&quot; at the prompt (e.g. steve$ man ls) and you will be taken to the man page for that command (in the terminal). Press &quot;q&quot; to exit the  man page.
</br>
</br><h2>Some more tips:</h2>
</br>Ctrl+C kills the current command. Use it to exit your programs if stuck in an infinite loop or taking too long to run. NEVER use it to exit your programs under normal conditions.
</br>
</br>Ctrl+D enters the end of file (EOF) character. It is a more elegant way of closing your programs, and closes the terminal if entered at the prompt.
</br>
</br>Ctrl+Z should NOT be used to close your programs. This is because it doesn't actually close them, just puts them in the background so you can't see them any more. You should never use this for command line only programs.
</br>
</br><h2>TAB Complete</h2>
</br>So important it has its own section. All commands and paths to files can be completed automatically by hitting the TAB key. This will save time and effort so use it when you can.
</br>
</br>E.g.
</br><pre>steve$ pwd
/home/steve
steve$ cd Doc
&lt;then hit tab and it will automatically become&gt;
steve$ cd Documents</pre>
Note that the command will not actually run until you press ENTER.

<h1>Text Editor</h1>
</br><h2>gedit</h2>
</br>Also, you will need a text editor with syntax highlighting.
</br>For beginners, I recommend gedit.
</br>Here is a link for gedit for mac:
</br><a href=http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/mac/gedit/2.30/gedit-2.30.2.dmg>gedit for mac</a>
</br>
</br><h2>Configuring gedit</h2>
</br>CSE has a style guide that you must adhere to. Part of that is 'soft' tabs. This is when your TAB key inserts spaces to emulate the behaviour of an actual TAB. Also, CSE requires that your tab width be 3 or 4. These can all be set from the Preferences window under the Editor tab.

<h1>C Compiler &#45; gcc</h1>
</br><h2>gcc</h2>
</br>gcc (the GNU C Compiler) is what we will be using to compile our code. Linux users will already have it. Mac users will need to install X Code which is available from the Apple website. Once X Code is installed, gcc can be run from the command line.
</br>
</br>To test if you have gcc installed, type gcc at the command line and press enter. If you get an error like &quot;bash: gcc: command not found&quot; then it's not installed, whereas if it says &quot;gcc: no input files&quot; then your fine.
</br>
</br>There are some options that should be used when compiling your C code with gcc. Options follow the command on the command line and are usually preppended with a '-'. When compiling code with gcc, your command line should look like this:
</br>
</br><pre>steve$ gcc -Wall -Werror -O -o helloworld helloworld.c</pre>

</br>What that all means
</br>gcc: the gnu c compiler
</br>-Wall: show all warnings
</br>-Werror: all warnings are treated as errors
</br>-O: optimise &#45; do low level operations that increase the performance of the program when it is run
</br>-o helloworld: produce a binary file as output named &quot;helloworld&quot;
</br>helloworld.c: the file containing the c code (source code) for the program.
</br>
</br>Running this command will create an executable file named &quot;helloworld&quot; in the working directory. To run it you would type:
</br><pre>./helloworld.</pre>
