<h1>Passing by Value</h1>
Let's do a quick experiment. Consider the code below.

codefile: failswap.c handle: failswap code: 1

Clearly, the swap function swaps the values of the two arguments right?
Here is the output:

codefile: failout handle: fail code: 0

<h2>So what happened?</h2>
C uses something called <strong>Pass by Value</strong> when passing arguments to functions. This means that a local "copy" of the variables is used inside the functions. The bottom line is, any changes made to the argumensts will not affect the original values (it will only affect the copies inside the function). These copies effectively disappear after the function returns, and the only value that can be accessed is its return value.
