<h1>Ideal Arrays</h1>
Let's begin by looking at using arrays for the purpose for which they were intended. <i>Ideal</i> is in the same sence as the ideal capacitor. For now we will not look at how arrays actually work - what happens behind the scenes. This will be covered soon.

An array is a list of variables of a single type. (ie. they are all integers, or all chars, etc) They are declared in the same way to variables, but with square brackets containing the size of the array. (size of array: how many values can be stored) When accessing elements of an array, use the name of the array followed by square brackets containing the index of the desired element.

Here is an example of code using an array.

codefile: array.c handle: array code: 1

output

codefile: arrayout handle: arrayout code: 0

Note that the highest index you can give to an array is one LESS than its size.
