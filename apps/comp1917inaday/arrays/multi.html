<h1>Multi-dimensianal Arrays</h1>
You can have arrays of as many dimensions as you like. For example a 2D array is an array of arrays. You can think of it as a 2D grid of values. When declaring a 2D array, use a pair of square brackets with the "dimensions" of the array. Adding more dimensions is the same process, however you seldom use more than 2 dimensions.

The following example uses a 2D array to print a circle.

codefile: circle.c handle: circle code: 1

output

codefile: circleout handle: circleout code: 0

This essentially builds an array of flags for each point, then uses the array to draw a circle. There are loads of uses for 2D arrays. Any time when you need to store data about a grid, you should probably use a 2D array.

The above code also shows how a for loop nested inside another for loop can be used to traverse a 2D array.
