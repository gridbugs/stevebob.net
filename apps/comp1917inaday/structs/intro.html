<h1>Structs</h1>
Ever wanted to create your own type of variable? Structs allow you to group variables together to form what are essentially new types of variables. The <strong>struct</strong> keyword is used to create new structs. Here is an example of code that uses structs.

codefile: structs.c handle: structs code: 1

That example doesn't output anything, but shows the syntax to use when dealing with structs. They are useful to group together variables that store data about concepts or things in the real world. Oh, and don't forget the semicolin after the close parenthesis. It will break all your code. If you find one day that all your code is broken, this should be one of the first places you look.
