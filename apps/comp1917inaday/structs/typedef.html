<h2>typedef</h2>
Having to type the word 'struct' every time we want to use our home made variables is kind of a nuisance. Fortunately, there is a workaround. The keyword <strong>typedef</strong> is used to create 'synonyms' for data types. It is mainly used to make one word synonyms for struct variables. The convention for synonyms is to start with a capital letter, then camel case. Here is the example above, with typedefs.

codefile: typedef.c handle: typedef code: 1
