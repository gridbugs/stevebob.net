<h1>While Loops</h1>

These are syntatically identical to if statements, except the keyword "if" is replaced with "while". The condition is checked, the code inside is evaluated if true, and repeat. The loop will only exit when the condition is false. Here is an example of some code with a while loop.

codefile: guess.c handle: guess code: 1

output

codefile: guessout handle: guessout code: 0

Notice the variable "solved". This is an example of a <strong>flag</strong>. A flag is a variable that is usually either set to 0 (false) or 1 (true) and often used to help evaluate a logical expression in a condition. In this case, the flag is initially false, as the user has not yet successfully guessed the number. The loop will terminate when the flag is set to true, or the number of tries left reaches 0. When the user guesses correctly, the flag is set to true. 

Flags can also be used in if statements if you want to check how a logical expression was evaluated later in the code. Rather than re-evaluating the expression, you can set a flag in the if statement, then just check the value of the flag later on.
