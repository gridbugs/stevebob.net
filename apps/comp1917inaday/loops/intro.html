<h1>Introduction to Loops</h1>
With what we have covered so far, the "flow" of our programs is one way only. Each line is evaluated at most once. However it is very useful to be able to do certain actions multiple times. This is achieved with <strong>loops</strong>. The two structures of loops we will look at are while loops and for loops.
