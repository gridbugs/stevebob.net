<h1>For Loops</h1>
For loops are a special type of loop for a particular (but common) situation. This is when a counter is required and something needs to be done a certain number of times. You will probably find that you use these far more than while loops. Everything that can be done with a for loop can be done with a while loop, but for loops provide an elegant, readible approach to this particular case. Here is an example:

codefile: tables.c handle: tables code: 1

output

codefile: tableout handle: tableout code: 0

The part in the brackets in the first line of a for loop has 3 parts seperated by semicolons.
The first part is what happens before the for loop starts iterating.
The second part is a condition that while true, the for loop will iterate.
The third part is something that happens after each iteration.

The common case is to use these parts to maintain a counter variable that ensures that the for loop iterates a certain number of times.
In the first part you initialise the variable. (i=0)
In the second part you give a condition that become false after a certain number of iterations.(i&lt;10)
In the third part you make the counter "count". (i++)

The counter variable must be declared before the for loop. "i, j, k..." are common naming conventions for these types of counter variables. The counter variable can be accessed from inside the for loop. After the loop exits, the value of the counter will be such that it doesn't satisfy the condition.
