<h1>GCD Solutions</h1>
Naive Solution:
codefile: naive.c handle: naive code: 1

But we can do much better than this.
A quick modification that would make it more efficient is to start counting from a higher number and stop as soon as 
we find a common divisor.
This reduces the number of iterations from the value of the smallest number to that value minus the gcd of the two.
Note that in the worst case (when the integers are coprine) the number of iterations will be the same.
Here is the modified code:

codefile: optimised.c handle: optimised code: 1

But still we can do better.
The Euclidean algorithm is an efficent way to calcute the gcd of a pair of integers.
Here is how it works.
Take the larger of the two, and subtract the smaller of the two until the result is less than the smaller integer.
Repeat this process by taking the smaller integer from the previous step and using it as the larger one, with the result from the subtraction as the new smaller integer.
When the result becomes 0, the smaller integer in that step is the gcd.
More explinations and a proof can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">here</a>.
Here is an implementation of this algorithm in c:

codefile: euclid.c handle: euclid code: 1
