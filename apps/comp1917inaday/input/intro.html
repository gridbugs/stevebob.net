<h1>Reading from Standard Input</h1>
It is often important for users to be able to interact with your program. The simplest way to read input in c is the scanf function. The f stands for formatted. Here is an example of it's use.

The program will prompt users for input, calculate the volume, then print it to standard output.

scanf uses the same placeholders as printf. The string which makes up the first argument can contain placeholders and white space seperating them. Having white space between placeholders in the string means in the input that users give can have any amount of white space in the corresponding places. It will keep waiting for input until the same number of input items as are placeholders are given. scanf returns the number of placeholders that were of the correct type. This can be used for validating input.

The arguments following the initial one are memory addresses of variables that will take on the enterred values.

You will notice the ampersand (&amp;) before the name of each variable. The ampersand means "memory address of". There will be more on this later. For now, just remember that scanf will not work without the ampersands.

When dealing with standard input, remember that after characters are scanned, they are removed from standard input. This means that it can sometimes be a challenge to read input in certain forms. Sometimes you need a little more control. A really useful function for reading input is getchar.
