<h1>Safety</h1>
 C doesn't care how much memory is alocated for the char array, and will continue into unowned memory if you tell it to. (don't) It will even go so far as to change values here, however this usually leads to segmentation faults. Seg faults are favourable to their alternative in most if not all cases. The alternative is, some memory somewhere in your program gets modified without you knowing about it. Later, when you try to access it, it has changed, and you have no idea why. If you ever find variables being mysteriously changed, or other weird things happening (like calling printf modifing values) you have an array or pointer somewhere that is being used incorrectly.
