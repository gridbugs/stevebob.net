<h1>Pointers and Arrays</h1>

Pointers and arrays are <strong>essentially the same things</strong>.
Did that not just blow your mind?
<br />
This code should help you understand:

codefile: pointersarearrays.c handle: array code: 1
<br />
output:

codefile: arrayoutput handle: araryout code: 0
<br />
There is a slight difference between arrays and pointers.
When you declare an array, some memory is set asside for that array.
(The amount of memory depends on the number in square brackets.)
So when you say "int list[10];" space for 10 consecutive integers is set aside and a pointer is created that stores
the address of the first integer.
By consecutive, I mean that if we imagine all the computer's memory to be a collection of boxes side by side, 
all the integers in the array are in an unbroken chain of boxes.
When you declare a pointer, no extra memory is allocated.
You can manually alocate memory using a function called "malloc", but more on that later.
