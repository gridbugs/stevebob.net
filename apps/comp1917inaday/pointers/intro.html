<h1>Memory</h1>
When you declare a variable in c, some memory is alocated to that variable. The value that the variable holds is of course stored in that memory. All the memory in a computer is numbered. A number that refers to memory is called a <strong>Memory Address</strong>. In modern computers, a memory address will be made up of either 32 bits or 64  bits depending on the machine. Some times it is useful to be able to store the memory address of a variable in another variable. The latter variable is known as a <strong>pointer</strong>.
