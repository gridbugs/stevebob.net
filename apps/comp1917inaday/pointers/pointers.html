<h1>Pointers</h1>
Lets jump straight into it.

<h2>Pointer Syntax</h2>
When declaring a pointer variable, use the type of the variable to which it will point, an asterisk, then the name of the pointer variable.
If you want to access the value stored in the memory to which the pointer points, use an asterisk followed by the pointer's name. This is called <strong>dereferencing</strong>.
To obtain the memory address of a variable, use an ampersand followed by the variable's name.

<h2>scanf</h2>
Now, remember how when using scanf you pass variables as arguments preceded by ampersands.
If we just passed the variables, the scanf function would only have a copy of the variables, and not be able to do anything with the original variables.
Using the ampersands, we actually pass the memory address to scanf.
The scanf function can then go and place values at that address in memory, which is how it stores values in variables.
